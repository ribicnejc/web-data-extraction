 * Road runner idea. Read two html documents. Create DOM tree for both of them and then
 * walk over the whole tree, and where you find attrs that are not the same, mark as important
 * data and continue walking. Important thing is that when finding different values, runner must
 * find position where the next "div" tag is the same.
